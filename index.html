  <h2>Happy Mother’s Day!</h2>

  <p>Mom, you are the heart of our family, and our love for you goes beyond words. Today, we celebrate you — your kindness, your strength, and the love you’ve poured into our lives.</p>

  <p>Thank you for every sacrifice, every hug, every laugh, and every lesson. You are truly the center of everything we hold dear.</p>

  <p>To honor the memories we've shared, I’ve created this website — a place where you can click through snapshots of our journey together as we all grow.</p>

  <p>Happy Mother’s Day! You mean the world to us.</p>

  <blockquote>"A mother's love is the fuel that enables a normal human being to do the impossible." – Marion C. Garretty</blockquote>

  <h2>Photo Gallery</h2>
  <div class="gallery">
    <img src="photos/basic-training.jpg" alt="Mom and baby after basic training">
    <p>I felt like this was the perfect photo to add here because it shows just how strong of a woman you are. From the moment you learned that your life would forever change, you've been making sacrifices to give your children a better life. (And I think you’ve done pretty darn well so far.)</p>
    <p>At 21, I now see those sacrifices in a new light. I understand the weight you carried — the ache of leaving, the strength it took to keep going, and the courage to return, knowing that every sacrifice was for something bigger.</p>
    <p>You fought for your dreams, for our future, for us.</p>
    <!-- New Photo: Graduation -->
    <img src="photos/graduation.jpg" alt="My high school graduation">
    <p>My high school graduation, a milestone I worked so hard for. As the firstborn, I’ve always felt the weight of expectation, but also the warmth of knowing I’m paving the way for the rest of the family. This photo isn’t just a celebration of my achievement, but a reflection of all the love, sacrifice, and encouragement you've given me.</p>
<!-- Wedding Photo -->
  <img src="photos/wedding.jpg" alt="Mom and Ortiz on their wedding day">
  <p>Mom, today marks the day you married Ortiz! What a special day it is. I knew from the start that this moment would be different, because today, I knew you were finally going to be taken care of the way you deserve. Ever since Ortiz came into our lives, he’s brought balance to the beautiful chaos of our family. Who would've thought that moving to Alabama would change everything? Sometimes I wonder if the universe placed us there just so you could share a slice of cake with the person meant for you.</p>
  <p>It’s like he’s your missing puzzle piece. He grounds you, and in him, I see you flourish; not just as a partner, but as a person. The way he loves and respects you shows me what love is supposed to look like. If I’m ever lucky enough to have a relationship, I hope it feels like yours.</p>
  <p>You’re not just surviving life anymore—you’re living it, fully and joyfully. Congratulations again on your marriage, Mom. Here’s to forever.</p>
<!-- Smiles Photo -->
<img src="photos/smiles.jpg" alt="Our family smiling with the teeth you paid for">
<p>This one’s for the smiles: literally! You’ve invested in every single one of these grins, and now we’ve got the confident, camera-ready smiles to prove it. From braces to retainers, dental visits to whitening strips, you’ve made sure we could smile big without holding back.</p>
<p>These teeth aren’t just straight, they’re a testament to your love, patience, and commitment to helping us put our best face forward (literally). Thank you for every appointment, every copay, and every “don’t forget to wear your retainer or did you brush your teeth” speech.</p>
